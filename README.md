I am a second-year PhD student in Statistics at UC Berkeley(link to the stat department). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Michael I. Jordan](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/). My research interests include reinforcement learning, theoretical machine learning and games. Prior to Berkeley, I completed a B. /MSc at [Ecole Polytechnique, Paris](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program).

I interned in the quantitative research team at [Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/) during the summers 2020 and 2022, supervised by [Julien Guyon](https://cermics.enpc.fr/~guyon/). I am grateful to have been a [Bloomberg Quant Fellow](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/values/tech-at-bloomberg/quantitative-finance-phd-fellowship/) in Spring 2022.
